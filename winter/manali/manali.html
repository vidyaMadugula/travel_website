                        Manali has an abundance of spectacular valleys filled with forests of oak, fir, deodar and pine. It is a full package of nature, food, adventure sports and ancient heritages. Splashing river Beas flows proudly amidst the valley. A lot of gushing waterfalls like Jogni falls and Rahala fall flush out of haphazardly placed rocks. You can also catch sights of sprawling meadows, terraced farming and fruit orchards. All these sights adds up to making the town look breathtakingly beautiful.
