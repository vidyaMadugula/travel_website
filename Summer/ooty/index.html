                        It is popularly called the Queen of Hill Stations. It was the summer capital of the Madras
                        Presidency.

                        Originally occupied by the Toda people, the area came under the rule of the East India Company
                        at the end of the 18th century. The economy is based on tourism and agriculture, along with the
                        manufacture of medicines and photographic film. The town is connected by the Nilgiri ghat roads
                        and Nilgiri Mountain Railway.
