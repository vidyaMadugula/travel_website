                        Gangtok is the capital of the mountainous northern Indian state of Sikkim. Established as a
                        Buddhist pilgrimage site in the 1840s, the city became capital of an independent monarchy after
                        British rule ended, but joined India in 1975. Today, it remains a Tibetan Buddhist center and a
                        base for hikers organizing permits and transport for treks through Sikkim’s Himalayan mountain
                        ranges.Most of Sikkim, including Gangtok, is underlain by Precambrian rocks which contain
                        foliated phyllites and schists; slopes are therefore prone to frequent landslides.
