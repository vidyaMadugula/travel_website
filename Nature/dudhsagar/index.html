                        Dudhsagar(lit. 'Sea of Milk') is 60 km from Panaji by road and is located on the Belgavi–Vasco
                        Da Gama rail route about 46
                        km east of Madgaon and 80 km south of Belgavi. Dudhsagar Falls is amongst India's tallest
                        waterfalls with a height of 310 m (1017 feet) and an average width of 30 metres (100 feet).The
                        area is surrounded by deciduous forests with rich biodiversity. This waterfall is also known as
                        Tambdi Surla to some of the local people. The falls are not particularly spectacular during the
                        dry season but during the monsoon season, however, the falls are fed by rains and form a huge
                        force of water.
