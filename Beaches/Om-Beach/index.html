                        Western Ghats on one side and the Arabian Sea on the other.Gokarna is known for the beaches.
                        The Gokarna main beach is in town and Kudle beach are west facing. One of the acclaimed beaches
                        in the country, Om Beach takes the shape of an ‘Om’, a
                        Hindu spiritual symbol. In the shape of two crescents joined together to form an Om, the beach
                        offers a breathtaking view of the sunset. The long stretch of white sandy beach adjoining the
                        rocky terrain appeals to travellers from around the world.
