                         districts of Idukki and Pathanamthitta in Kerala, India. It is notable as an elephant
                          reserve and a tiger reserve. The protected area encompasses 925 km2 (357 sq mi), 
                          of which 305 km2 (118 sq mi) of the core zone was declared as the Periyar National Park 
                          in 1982. The park is a repository of rare, endemic, and endangered flora and fauna and
                           forms the major watershed of two important rivers of Kerala: the Periyar and the Pamba.
