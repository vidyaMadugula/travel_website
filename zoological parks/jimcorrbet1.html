                        Jim Corbett National Park is a national park in India located 
                        in the Nainital district of Uttarakhand state. The first national park in India,
                         it was established in 1936 during the British Raj and named Hailey National Park after William Malcolm 
                         Hailey, a governor of the United Provinces in which it was then located. In 1956, nearly a decade after
                          India's independence, it was renamed Corbett National Park after the hunter and naturalist Jim Corbett,
                           who had played a leading role in its establishment and had died the year before.
                         The park was the first to come under the Project Tiger initiative.
