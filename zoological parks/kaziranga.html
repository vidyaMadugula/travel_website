                        Kaziranga National Park is a national park in the 
                        Golaghat and Nagaon districts of the state of Assam, India. The park, which hosts two-thirds of the
                         world's great one-horned rhinoceroses, is a World Heritage Site. According to the census held in March 
                         2018 which was jointly conducted by the Forest Department of the Government
                         of Assam and some recognized wildlife NGOs, the rhino population in Kaziranga National Park is 2,413.
                         Located on the edge of the Eastern Himalaya biodiversity hotspot, the park combines high species diversity and visibility. Kaziranga is a vast expanse of tall elephant grass, marshland, and dense tropical moist broadleaf forests, 
                         criss-crossed by four major rivers, including the Brahmaputra, and the park includes numerous 
                         small bodies of water.
