                        Hampi was the capital of the Vijayanagara Empire in the 14th century.It is a fortified city.
                        Chronicles left by Persian and European travellers, particularly the Portuguese, say that Hampi
                        was a prosperous,
                        wealthy and grand city near the Tungabhadra River, with numerous temples, farms and trading
                        markets. By 1500 CE,
                        Hampi-Vijayanagara was the world's second-largest medieval-era city after Beijing, and probably
                        India's richest at that time,
                        attracting traders from Persia and Portugal.
