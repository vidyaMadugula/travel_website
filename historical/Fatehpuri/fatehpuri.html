                        The dynastic architecture of Fatehpur Sikri was modelled on Timurid forms and styles.
                                 The city was built massively and preferably with red sandstone. Gujarati influences 
                                 are also seen in its architectural vocabulary 
                                 and decor of the palaces of Fatehpur Sikri.The city's architecture reflects both the Hindu and Muslim form of
                                  domestic architecture 
                                 popular in India at the time. The remarkable preservation of these original spaces allows modern archaeologists
                                  to reconstruct scenes of
                                  Mughal court life, and to better understand the hierarchy of the city's royal and noble residents
